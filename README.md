Rasterize points from shapefile

Unzip Data.zip to a folder point your data path there. I had to do this to bring s541.img raster below 100 MB github limit.
Please delete the files afterward, b/c I'm not supposed to send out copies per data agreement with DEC.

The spatial join caused python to crash many times for me, usually giving memory error, but after a few kernel restarts it works.

Add reveal.js folder to see as slides in Rasterize_Point_Data.slides.html, or as-is it will open as one long webpage.
